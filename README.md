# The Ray Tracer Challenge

At this point in my life I've become a compulsive book-buyer. I think it's because it can be
a nice shortcut to _looking_ smart without actually _being_ smart. The [Pragmatic Bookshelf](https://pragprog.com/)
is one of my favorite publishers, and at some point when browsing I came across [The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/) 
by Jamis Buck. For whatever reason I like a challenge (one time my therapist told me thatâ€”I don't think it's good), 
so I had to get it. I also wanted to work on my Rust a little beyond making a [snake clone](https://github.com/gusbmurphy/snake), 
and rendering images feels like a big part of computers!

So, here it is! Thanks for taking a look (why are you here to begin with?), if you'd like to run it, I guess just 
figure it out because I don't have that part of the `README` yet.
